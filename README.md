# Wedding Website

## Contributors
- Liam Salazar

## Overview
Our goal is to create a website for my upcoming wedding. This project will help with the cost of the wedding by avoiding purchasing RSVP cards. This README will have details about the different pages for the website. Project must be ready for deployment by ***End of January***.

## Tech Stack
We'll most likely use the MERN stack. This is a popular free, open-source JavaScript software stack, similar to MEAN. The only difference is that we will be using React to build our front-end, whereas MEAN uses Angular.
   
 - **M**ongoDB
 - **E**xpress.JS
 - **R**eact.JS
 - **N**ode.JS

## Must Have Functionalities
```
~~RSVP page will allow invitees to RSVP for the event and choose their food. Please refer to menu for list of items. We should also think about having some type of authentication for our website to prevent you typical schmuck from accessing the website.~~
```
```
Display a map that'll show the location of the event. If possible, mark these locations:
    - Wedding venue
    - Hotel (Once Sandra and I block the rooms)
```
```
A page should have details of our relationship or display pictures of the wedding party (plus Kenneth, since he's helping me with this website).
